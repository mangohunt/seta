Freddie Drxdd - LUCY#I lxb Lucy, and she lxbs me#We're as happy as two can be#Some-#Sacrificing bxcs in the middle of the street#Leaving your body bleeding like you were a piece of meat#Raw body skin on the fxkn pavement#Caved in skull with your brain on the wall#Freddie gunna kxll ya with tha pistol he be packin#Freddie is a kxlla no he never ever lackin#What the fk you thinkin bxh Iâ€™ll put you in the dirt#Watch the blood squirt from ya neck ya fxkn hurt#Smoking on the dope while I hxng you from a rope#Thinking bout the past#As you take your final breath#Look into my eyes#It is dark and I am wise#Fxkn with a kxlla#Gunna make you fxkn cry#Deep so deep in the motha fxkn forest#Lookin like some mulch I don't think no one will notice#Deep so deep in the motha fxkn forest#Lookin like some mulch I don't think no one will notice
